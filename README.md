# Gym-Analysis
An exploratory data analysis between different gym exercise, body parts worked, equipment required to perform these exercises.


### Inspiration
- If we go to a gym, the first thing you realize is the myriad of exercises available to do. The exercises range from bodyweight, machine-based or dumbbell/barbell based. With so many exercises to do, beginners or even professional can wonder which the exercise that will target a specific muscle the best and that is where this analysis can be useful. I also thought it would be fun to visualize the exercise details.


### Introduction

- Gym exercises play a crucial role in helping people achieve their fitness goals and maintain good health. With a wide variety of exercises available, it can be challenging for gym-goers to choose the right routine for their needs. In this project, we aim to analyze gym exercise data to gain a deeper understanding of the most popular exercises and how they are being performed.   

- We will be using a dataset that contains information on different gym exercises, such as the type of exercise, equipment used, and the level of fitness a person needs to perform these exercises. Our goal is to identify patterns and trends in the data, such as the most popular exercises and the factors that influence exercise performance. By analyzing this data, we hope to provide valuable insights for gym owners and managers, as well as gym-goers, to help them make informed decisions about their exercise routines.    

- This notebook is an <b>exploratory data analysis</b> between different gym exercise, body parts worked, equipment required to perform these exercises and much more. It is an analysis solely created because of my curiosity but I hope that the results deduced from the notebook are valuable.
